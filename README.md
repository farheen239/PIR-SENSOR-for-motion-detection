A PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor is widely used for motion detection by sensing the infrared radiation naturally emitted by warm objects such as humans or animals. The sensor remains passive, meaning it does not emit any signal but detects changes in heat levels within its field of view. When a person or object moves across the sensorâ€™s range, the variation in infrared energy is detected, triggering the sensor to send a signal indicating motion. This simple and energy-efficient mechanism makes PIR sensors ideal for applications like security systems, automatic lighting, and smart home devices.
